## NOTICE

For the tool to function correctly, you must provide a link to your unaltered `live_output` directory, as it contains the necessary `dataset.json` files. This path should be set as the `DATASETS_DIRECTORY` in your configuration and must point to `live_output` where your named directories with datasets in them are stored.

## Supported Pipelines

- meteor_m2-x_lrpt
- meteor_m2-x_hrpt
- noaa_dsb

## Clone the repository

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/satdump-log-visualiser.git

Run `install_requirements.py` by double clicking it or open a terminal and run `pip install -r requirements.txt`.


## Configure your setup

The config file is self-explanatory.
Update the `DATASETS_DIRECTORY`, and `LOG_DIRECTORY` paths.
Update `OBSERVER_LAT`, `OBSERVER_LON`, (and optionally `OBSERVER_ELEVATION`) to your actual location for accurate plots.

## Running the tool

Run `main.py` by simply clicking on it or open a terminal and run `pip install -r requirements.txt` within the tool directory.
